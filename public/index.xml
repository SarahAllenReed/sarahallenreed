      <title>Who Is Sarah Allen Reed?</title>

      <description>Born with a decidedly different name and assigned gender near Saint Louis, Missouri, Sarah picked up a pen at the age of eight and drew her first comic book, and&amp;ndash;despite the world&amp;rsquo;s valiant attempts to stop her&amp;ndash;that&amp;rsquo;s more or less what she’s been doing since. Her work deals with loss, queer issues, her own battles with mental illness and homelessness, and the psychology of trauma and religion.
She is the cartoonist behind Our Lady Maven, Tabula Rosetta, The Grizzly: Private Eye, and many others, and currently works providing illustrations and cover art for multiple record labels, publishers, and magazines the world over.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Sarah is a sure-footed comics artist whose sense of DIY ethos and love of the medium have combined to make something powerful and beautiful and truly her own. The struggle is real, but with a pen in our hands, the artist will find glory at its peak. Sarah&amp;rsquo;s work marks the emergence of a new leader on the rise with enough energy to drill through the toughest obstacles with the sharp edge of printed media and the blunt power of comics culture.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;I hired Sarah to make the album art for my full-length, as well as a t-shirt design based off of that. Sarah conducted herself in a helpful and professional manner throughout the entire experience; the consultation and quotation process were smooth and informative, and gave me confidence in hiring her services. She was communicative every step of the way, showing me progress pictures and regularly asking for my input. Of course, my input was barely needed aside from the initial consultation; her artistic ability is unparalleled!</description>

      <title>#001: A Fresh Start, Old Computers, and a New Coat Of Paint</title>
      <link>http://sarahallenreed.com/blog/0001/</link>

      <description>Hey, y&amp;rsquo;all. As you&amp;rsquo;ve most likely noticed, 2022 was&amp;hellip;.well, not a good year for social media. Twitter&amp;rsquo;s on fire, Facebook&amp;rsquo;s been under federal scrutiny for years now, and seeing as I don&amp;rsquo;t have a face for anything but radio, I&amp;rsquo;ve never bothered with Tiktok.
So, now that I&amp;rsquo;ve finally updated my website again, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to just go back to basics and start a little blog here instead. I&amp;rsquo;ve always been more long-winded than most social media sites want me to be as it is, and this kind of format gives me more of an opportunity to write a bit about things I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t normally get the chance to talk about otherwise.</description>
