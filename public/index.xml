      <description>A Short Biography And Semi-Professional Headshot  Born with a decidedly different name and assigned gender near Saint Louis, Missouri, Sarah picked up a pen at the age of eight and drew her first comic book, and&amp;ndash;despite the world&amp;rsquo;s valiant attempts to stop her&amp;ndash;that&amp;rsquo;s more or less what she&amp;rsquo;s been doing since. Her work deals with loss, queer issues, her own battles with mental illness and homelessness, and the psychology of trauma and religion.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Sarah is a sure-footed comics artist whose sense of DIY ethos and love of the medium have combined to make something powerful and beautiful and truly her own. The struggle is real, but with a pen in our hands, the artist will find glory at its peak. Sarah&amp;rsquo;s work marks the emergence of a new leader on the rise with enough energy to drill through the toughest obstacles with the sharp edge of printed media and the blunt power of comics culture.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;I hired Sarah to make the album art for my full-length, as well as a t-shirt design based off of that. Sarah conducted herself in a helpful and professional manner throughout the entire experience; the consultation and quotation process were smooth and informative, and gave me confidence in hiring her services. She was communicative every step of the way, showing me progress pictures and regularly asking for my input. Of course, my input was barely needed aside from the initial consultation; her artistic ability is unparalleled!</description>
