            <h1><a href="https://sarahallenreed.com/blog/0001/">#001: A Fresh Start, Old Computers, and a New Coat Of Paint</a></h1>
            
            <div class="post-content">
                <p>Hey, y&rsquo;all. As you&rsquo;ve most likely noticed, 2022 was&hellip;.well, not a good year for social media. Twitter&rsquo;s on fire, Facebook&rsquo;s been under federal scrutiny for years now, and seeing as I don&rsquo;t have a face for anything but radio, I&rsquo;ve never bothered with Tiktok.</p>
<p>So, now that I&rsquo;ve finally updated my website again, I&rsquo;ve decided to just go back to basics and start a little blog here instead. I&rsquo;ve always been more long-winded than most social media sites want me to be as it is, and this kind of format gives me more of an opportunity to write a bit about things I wouldn&rsquo;t normally get the chance to talk about otherwise.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been putting off updating my website for over a year and some change now. 2022 wasn&rsquo;t exactly my year, and even if I had the energy to do it then, I&rsquo;ve been so unreasonably busy that I wouldn&rsquo;t have had the time. But now I&rsquo;ve got more than enough time, and so in the interest of ensuring that I&rsquo;m not constrained to the character limit of Twitter or the weird &ldquo;photo not posted!&rdquo; behavior that Instagram gets every single time I write a caption that contains phrases like &ldquo;trans rights&rdquo;, &ldquo;nazis have no place in modern society&rdquo;, or &ldquo;fuck&rdquo;, I&rsquo;m going to do what a lot of other artists are doing and go back to longer-form writing here <em>ye olde web 1.0 style</em>.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t take long for me to think of an opening salvo, either. Seeing as I&rsquo;ve been happily plunking away on this computer terminal working on this codebase for half a month, I can&rsquo;t think of a better (or more stereotypically trans) topic to start with than my perpetual aesthetic obsession with my Linux desktop and open-source software, especially in an industry that isn&rsquo;t exactly known for going open source.</p>

<p>As a good portion of you know, I&rsquo;ve used Linux for the vast majority of my creative career. Given the fact that I do professional illustration, audio work, and creative work in general for a living, that&rsquo;s not what you&rsquo;d call a &ldquo;typical&rdquo; choice. Linux has a bad rap for being what most creative professionals would refer to as &ldquo;functionally unusable&rdquo; (and for good reason, especially in the professional audio space). I&rsquo;ve been involved in free and open source software since I was a teenager, however, and at this point I can&rsquo;t really imagine using anything else.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s quite a few reasons I use free, libre, and open-source software (or FLOSS, for short) in nearly every applicable scenario I can (and tend towards using abandonware and old software when I can&rsquo;t)&ndash;it aligns with a good percentage of my principles and way of being in the world, I appreciate the freedom to cusomize and tinker, I can&rsquo;t stand rent-seeking behavior in corporations that like to clamp down monopolies on certain industries (especially creative fields), etc., etc., ad infinitum. With that stated, there is a fairly importing contributing factor as for why I got into Linux in the first place: I&rsquo;m poor as all get out, and always have been. Linux is a lot of things to a lot of people, but for me it has one thing that has always set it above the rest&ndash;free as in freedom. I got into Linux back in the days when I couldn&rsquo;t afford a computer that can run anything else. The vast majority of my early career saw me too poor to afford anything even remotely close to cutting edge, and so I just grabbed whatever computer I could find, slapped Linux on it, and made the little bastard do what I needed it to do. And to this day, I&rsquo;ve been happily doing the same thing with all my computers ever since.</p>

  </p>
  <p> My current IDE, vscodium (a telemetry-free, open source fork of Visual Studio Code). Also shown is the equivalent of my "start menu", <a href="https://github.com/davatorium/rofi">rofi</a>. </p>
</div>
<p>At this point in history, it&rsquo;s fairly easy to get your hands on a relatively usable thin-client (like the Lenovo Thinkcentre M93p I&rsquo;m using here) and it&rsquo;s also easier than ever to customize whichever distro you&rsquo;re using to get it to behave exactly how you want, or just to pick and download a free and open-source distribution of Linux tailor-made to audio production or graphics and bonk it over the head to function however you want. With companies like Adobe having a reputation for needlessly screwing over their customers at any given opportunity and other companies that were, at one point, &ldquo;better about that&rdquo; going much the same way, there&rsquo;ll probably be fewer better times to switch.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t use a stock distribution. Never really have. What you&rsquo;re seeing here is a borderline <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/unixporn">/r/unixporn</a>-ready power user workstation, beaten into the ground and painted in a nice patina of trans- and femboy-pride colors. (Just like this website, <a href="https://variant-archive.tumblr.com/post/179097473122/femboy-pride-flag">if you didn&rsquo;t catch the intentional color scheme choices</a>.) That&rsquo;s not a purely stylistic choice (although I do have a fondness for the artistic merit of a finely tuned-workstation) as much as it is force of habit. For the longest time, all I had to work with and create work with were 10-15 year old laptops, and if you&rsquo;ve ever had to get a crotchety old crank like a IBM T60 humming again, you&rsquo;ll know that there&rsquo;s nothing that can do the job quite like a minimalistic desktop environment and using nothing but command-line apps for every task you can squeeze into a <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/rxvt-unicode">urxvt</a> window.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I don&rsquo;t have to do much of that sort of thing anymore (although I do keep my old Thinkpads very close to my heart, <a href="/resume/bio">as you can see in my author photo in the &ldquo;about me&rdquo; page on this website</a>&ndash;that lil&rsquo; guy there is my beloved Thinkpad X60, Conseil.) and can use the full range of what modern open-source software has to offer to my advantage. I currently run two different computers for 90% of my production; a Lenovo Thinkpad P90 (named after my beloved Piranese mix, Polyhymnia) that sits just above my drawing board that I use for listening to radio shows, podcasts, and Let&rsquo;s Plays while I work on inks (and which hooks directly down into my oversized scanner and an ancient screenless Wacom tablet in case I need to do digital touch-up or color work on whichever piece I&rsquo;m working on) and this little old guy here, Herotodus (named after the ancient Greek historian).</p>
<div class="floatleft caption"">

  </p>
  <p> The ol' battlestation. Herotodus (the computer) sitting on Goliath (the secretary desk), ready for action. </p>
</div>
<p>If it involves me having to do some writing in any form, be it research for a new book, bullet journalling, hacking away on the website or other development projects, working with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten">index card catalogue that I use in lieu of a functioning memory</a>, or even reading a bit, Herodotus and Goliath (the secretary desk she sits on) is the dynamic duo I turn to. I&rsquo;ve also managed to do quite a bit with Winetricks to get some of my favorite classic games running, so you can often catch me in the mornings in the studio playing a hand of Cribbage or Spades or running through some old text adventure games as well.</p>
<p>The nice thing about a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin_client">thin client</a> is that you can fit the little guys damn near anywhere&ndash;in a drawer, wedged between some books, mounted underneath the desk, or really anywhere you can think of that you can pipe some cords out of. I can&rsquo;t look you in the eye and tell you that I&rsquo;m a strict observer of the teachings of the Church of Cable Management, but I am someone who believes in doing the equivalent of &ldquo;going on Christmas and Easter to see Grampa and take a family photo in the name of keeping up appearances&rdquo;. Some rubber bands, a bit of &ldquo;shove the cables in back of stuff&rdquo; and the old &ldquo;wrap the cords around the monitor&rdquo; trick are more than enough for me.</p>
<p>Herotodus is hooked into an old-school 4:5 aspect ratio monitor I snagged from an old job I worked at. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s neurodiverse impulse, writer&rsquo;s habit <em>a la</em> <a href="https://www.jeremyutley.design/blog/the-daily-discipline">Jerry Seinfeld&rsquo;s old &ldquo;yellow legal pads&rdquo;</a>, or just plain old aesthetics, but I can&rsquo;t seem to function with anything involving getting words or code down if I&rsquo;m not typing it out on a clicky keyboard and seeing it displayed on a 4:3 or similar aspect ratio monitor. 16:9 doesn&rsquo;t do it for me, for some reason. I&rsquo;ve had my fair share of CRTs as well over the years&ndash;they&rsquo;re just easier on the eyes, at least for me&ndash;but not only will one not fit on top of Goliath at any viewable angle but the only one I have currently seems to have burnt out. (Quite frankly, I&rsquo;d use my ancient Brother WP-3550 as a daily driver if I could&ndash;but that&rsquo;s a topic for when I inevitably get around to spending a post opining about my typewriter and word processor collection.) This ancient HP 1755 does its job though, and I do love its side-mounted USB ports for transferring files and what-not, as well as its sturdiness. The old girl&rsquo;s built like a tank. I&rsquo;ve always admired that in a lady.</p>

  My favorite Monday morning pasttime, Sierra Online's "Hoyle Card Games 2005", running through <a href="https://winehq.org">Wine.</a> Yes, you can have your table partner be a giant grizzly bear. Yes, he talks. His name is Harley. No, I'm not happy about this hand either.
  </p>
</div>
<p>As far as software goes, I use a plethora of open-source software in my daily workflow. The entire system itself is a weird frankenstein monster of piping <a href="https://github.com/Airblader/i3">i3gaps</a> through <a href="https://www.xfce.org/">XFCE</a>&ndash;you can check out <a href="https://feeblenerd.blogspot.com/2015/11/pretty-i3-with-xfce.html">The Feeble Nerd&rsquo;s post on the subject</a> if you want to know how to set that up&ndash;with a good amount of UI/UX customizations as well. Me being the absolute fruit I am (and also prone to headaches when confronted with any color emanating from a screen writ large that isn&rsquo;t a variation upon a theme of black or grey), I&rsquo;ve customized almost the entire thing in the pinkest and purplest colors I can find and installed a bunch of plugins and custom themes to ensure I never have to deal with &ldquo;light-mode&rdquo; anything if I can avoid it. At some point, I&rsquo;ll probably clean up and upload my config files to my <a href="https://github.com/sarahallenreed">Github</a> so anyone who&rsquo;s interested can clone them and customize them to their liking; if that happens, I&rsquo;ll link it here.</p>
<p>For practical software, I use <a href="https://gimp.org">GIMP</a> for graphics editing and tinkering with larger UI elements, <a href="https://vscodium.com/">VS Codium</a> with a Vim emulation plugin for programming and other code manangement work (although <a href="https://github.blog/2022-06-08-sunsetting-atom/">I used Atom until the crooks bought out Github and sunsetted the poor thing</a>; RIP to the best IDE I&rsquo;ve ever used), <a href="https://novelwriter.io/">novelwriter</a> for long-form document editing and planning (i.e. graphic novels, games, and other things that require keeping track of characters, settings, and concepts) <a href="https://ghostwriter.kde.org/">ghostwriter</a> for shorter-form Markdown pieces (like this blog here!) and a few other odds and ends here and there for other workflow-related things. I also use <a href="https://www.winehq.org/">Wine</a> and <a href="https://www.dosbox.com/">DosBox</a> to emulate old PC games, <a href="https://mednafen.github.io/">Mednafen</a>, <a href="https://www.carpeludum.com/kega-fusion/">Kega-Fusion</a>, and a couple other emulators for console games, and I do play a fair amount of Linux games as well. <a href="https://pysolfc.sourceforge.io/">PySolFC</a> is a perennial favorite.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re moving studios (and states!) in a few months here, and while I&rsquo;m not looking forward to carting an entire secretary desk and an army of computers, typewriters, and sundry halfway across the country for the umpteenth time, I can&rsquo;t honestly imagine studio life without them. (Plus, I need the typewriters to give you folks half the lettering that shows up in <a href="https://ourladymaven.com/">Our Lady Maven!</a> It just wouldn&rsquo;t be the same if I used a font&hellip;)</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know how often I&rsquo;ll be updating this blog, but seeing as I don&rsquo;t have Twitter anymore (which means I don&rsquo;t have many other outlets to talk about games, books, and records I&rsquo;ve been fascinated by in the studio), I can&rsquo;t look you in the eye and tell you I&rsquo;m completely invested in keeping Instagram around, and after years of having to use social media as a professional in this industry I&rsquo;ve been burnt out to all hell on the entire concept, this is more or less going to be what I use to keep y&rsquo;all updated.
A large part of my struggle over the past couple years has been balancing the need for a &ldquo;professional freelance illustrator branding&rdquo; with the part of me that genuinely loves and wants to talk about creative pursuits, weird inspirations, and the troubles, tribulations, and triumphs of life that inspire a lot of my work in an honest and genuine manner. I&rsquo;ve gone through a lot of different thoughts on how to tackle that problem, but this is probably gonna be how I do that, and I&rsquo;ll try and update it at least a couple times a month to let y&rsquo;all know what I&rsquo;ve been working on, what I&rsquo;ve been enraptured in, and what I&rsquo;ve been listening to.</p>
<p>You definitely don&rsquo;t have to read every single post on here if you don&rsquo;t want to, but hopefully this will be a nice little window into the life and thought process of the giant dork who pens and voices what (I&rsquo;d hope) are some of your favorite comics, books, and radio shows. If you want to get ahold of me to ask some questions about whatever it is I wrote about, request a topic for me to write a bit about (ask me about bits of my artistic process, for instance) or just send me a letter, you can check out <a href="/resume/bio">my current mailing and email address over on the About Me page.</a>. Maybe I&rsquo;ll do a lil&rsquo; letter column if I get enough mail.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re all amazing and don&rsquo;t let anyone tell you that you&rsquo;re not. Talk soon.</p>
