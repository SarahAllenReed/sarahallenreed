            <div class="post-content">
                <hr>
<h2 id="rates-and-policies">Rates And Policies</h2>
<p>All rates and terms listed are subject to change at any time, and I up these rates once a year at minimum to keep up with my cost of living and ever-expanding qualifications. I do allow freelance clients the option to keep my services on retainer for a negotiable fixed rate for those who would see themselves requiring my services and qualifications on a more frequent basis; for more information on this, <a href="mailto:sarah@sarahallenreed.com">please email me.</a></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="skillset">Skillset</h2>
<p>The pieces of my skillset with which I am available for work currently includes, but is not limited to, the following:</p>
<h4 id="illustration----">Illustration &mdash;</h4>
<ul>
<li>Full package design for books, records, games, and other types of products</li>
<li>Poster, logo, and other marketing design materials</li>
<li>Spot illustration</li>
<li>Pencils, inks, flats, and full color page work for sequential art</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="audio----">Audio &mdash;</h4>
<ul>
<li>Remixes and reworkings of existing tracks</li>
<li>Commercial, short film, or full-album soundtracks</li>
<li>Voiceover and dictation services, including audiobook recording</li>
</ul>
<p>I am currently available for freelance work and commissioned pieces, as well as full- or part-time staff positions should you wish to retain my services.</p>
<p>Finally, if you would like to learn about my techniques, I am also available for private illustration lessons, either over Skype or Discord or in person at my studio. <a href="mailto:sarah@sarahallenreed.com">Please email me if you would like to know more.</a></p>
<hr>
<h4 id="design-and-illustration----">Design And Illustration &mdash;</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>My current minimum rate for illustration and design (including original art, layout work, package design, most short sequential art pieces, and most other visual work) is <em>65/hr, minimum 2 hours.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most smaller pieces, depending on detail, run about four to eight hours. I keep timesheets for your references/files, and upon asking a couple quick questions about what you require, I will provide you with a quick estimate (which is not a final bill, mind; the final amount of hours needed for any given job can go up and down depending on a variety of factors, all of which will be explained in the timesheets) and I will request half of the estimate up front before work begins. <em>Deposits are non-refundable.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I require a two-week minimum turnaround time per image. If you need your piece sooner than two weeks (&ldquo;rush jobs&rdquo;), the entire estimate must be paid up front, and the payment is non-refundable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I retain ownership, copyright and publishing rights of whatever art, music, or design that I create. I often do retrospective collections and retaining publishing rights to my illustrations makes this an easier process. This is negotiable, but my rate per hour will double should you insist upon exclusive rights.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><strong>You are not allowed to create NFTs of any of my work. Full stop.</strong></em> For more info on why I am opposed to NFTs, I highly recommend you read <a href="https://www.ntdaily.com/nfts-are-not-just-bad-for-the-environment-they-are-also-stupid/">this article.</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, should you request a hard copy of the piece itself, that absolutely is workable; I draw nearly all of my art by hand, and I&rsquo;m more than happy to ship the image to you in exchange for the shipping costs. While I often use whatever is on hand for most projects, I am more than happy to use archival materials, paper, and inks at no additional charge for yours should you decide to request the hard copy, so that the original of your piece will stand the test of time. Shipping, however, will be an extra charge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><strong>All payments are final and non-refundable.</strong></em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="logo-design----">Logo Design &mdash;</h4>
<ul>
<li>Most logo designs are ran at a flat rate of $150, paid up front. For more information, <a href="mailto:sarah@sarahallenreed.com">please email me.</a></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="sequentialcomics-art----">Sequential/Comics Art &mdash;</h4>
<ul>
<li>I am currently available for long-term and short-term sequential art assignments. The rate listed above for design and illustration applies for most short (four pages or less) sequential comics pieces only; if what you would need from me is more along the lines of a series, a graphic novel, or anything else longer than four pages or so, a per-page rate, contract, and payment plan will be negotiated during the initial discussions.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="musical-and-auditory-work----">Musical And Auditory Work &mdash;</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Please <a href="mailto:sarah@sarahallenreed.com">email me directly</a> for information about mastering, voiceover, soundtrack, or songwriting rates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I do not do ghostwriting for musical projects, and will insist upon a production credit on any musical work I am a part of.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you, your venue, or your promotions agency would like to book one of my bands, I am often more than happy to work with you; <a href="mailto:sarah@sarahallenreed.com">please reach out via email</a> to discuss any plans you may have to that end.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="web-design----">Web Design &mdash;</h4>
<ul>
<li>Please email me directly for web design rates. This service is currently only available either on retainer or via part- or full-time employment.</li>
</ul>
<p>I currently accept Paypal. For alternative payment methods, please ask.</p>

<p>If you would like to contact me for a business or professional inquiry, or if you have a question about my work in any capacity, please direct all inquiries to:</p>
