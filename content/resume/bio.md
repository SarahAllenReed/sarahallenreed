### A Short Biography And Semi-Professional Headshot

---

<img src="/about2.png" class="floatright"/>

Born with a decidedly different name and assigned gender near Saint Louis, Missouri, Sarah picked up a pen at the age of eight and drew her first comic book, and--despite the world's valiant attempts to stop her--that's more or less what she's been doing since. Her work deals with loss, queer issues, her own battles with mental illness and homelessness, and the psychology of trauma and religion.

She is the cartoonist behind [Our Lady Maven](https://ourladymaven.com/about-us/), [Tabula Rosetta](https://theblackworkorganization.bigcartel.com/category/tabula-rosetta), and [many others](/resume/bibliography/biblio/), and currently works providing illustrations and cover art for [multiple record labels, publishers, and magazines the world over](/resume/clientreview/). She is also a member of the [Graphic Artists Guild](https://graphicartistsguild.org/member-portfolio/sarahallenreed), and her work can be found in the permanent collection of the [Billy Ireland Cartoon Library & Museum](https://osucartoons.pastperfectonline.com/webobject/3409A1CD-4D48-4E97-8E01-545875413354) in Columbus and the [Butler Library](https://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/archival/collections/ldpd_13399267/) at Columbia University in New York, as well as many other public and private collections.

Sonically, her voice can be found as the lead vocalist and main composer of [Ophelia Drowning](https://opheliadrowning.bandcamp.com), [Coma Roulette](https://comaroulette.bandcamp.com), and a few other projects, and her compositions and voice can be found in [numerous other musical projects as well](/audio). As a radio host, she can currently be heard weekly as the voice of The Jazz Program and The Talkie Time Radio Hour on [datafruits.fm](https://datafruits.fm). She is also known as the former voice of extreme music program The Forest At Night, which was heard on [Radio Dark Tunnel](https://radio-dark-tunnel.net).

When she's not busy plowing away at her drawing board, singing dirges in the moonlight, or wandering throughout the United States, she can often be found tending to her ivies, frying up some biscuits, spending unreasonable hours in the gym, or floating above the Mississippi River at midnight, waiting for the tide to wrap her in its loving embrace and take her away.

She currently resides in a safehouse in an unknown location with her fuzzy companion Polyhymnia and frequent collaborator Autumn Redacted; although, as with everything else in life, this is subject to change.
