<br/>

Born with a decidedly different name and assigned gender near Saint Louis, Missouri, Sarah picked up a pen at the age of eight and drew her first comic book, and--despite the world's valiant attempts to stop her--that's more or less what sheâ€™s been doing since. Her work deals with loss, trans and queer issues, her own battles with mental illness and homeless, and the psychology of trauma and religion.

In her long and varied career, she has written multiple books and records, been featured in several anthologies, and worked on many comix series. She is the editor and publisher of the underground small press collective [The Blackwork Organization](http://blackwork.org), and is a regular contributor to the work of the games company [Tempest Tome](https://www.tempesttomegames.com/). [Her work](https://sarahallenreed.com/catalogue) can be found in multiple public and private collections, most of which are still standing.

When she's not busy hanging out in the back of her Econoline van, drawing away at a greasy spoon, messing with one of her pet Linux servers, playing her bass guitar in the moonlight, or wandering throughout the United States, she can often be found arranging flowers, cooking, working out, painting, or floating above the coast at midnight, waiting for the tide to wrap her in its loving embrace and take her away.

She currently resides somewhere deep in the Colorado backcountry; although, as with everything else in life, this is subject to change.
