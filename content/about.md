<br/>
Born with a decidedly different name and assigned gender near Saint Louis, Missouri, Sarah picked up a pen at the age of eight and drew her first comic book, and--despite the world's valiant attempts to stop her--that's more or less what sheâ€™s been doing since. Her work deals with loss, trans and queer issues, her own battles with mental illness and homelessness, and the psychology of trauma and religion.

In her long and varied career, she has written multiple books and records, been featured in several anthologies, and worked on creative projects for clients, labels, and publishers around the world. [Her work](https://sarahallenreed.com/resume) can be found in multiple public and private collections, most of which are still standing.

When she's not busy plowing away at her drawing board, singing dirges in the moonlight, or wandering throughout the United States, she can often be found tending to her flowers, cooking, working out, painting, or floating above the coast at midnight, waiting for the tide to wrap her in its loving embrace and take her away.

She currently resides in Colorado with her service dog Polyhymnia; although, as with everything else in life, this is subject to change.
