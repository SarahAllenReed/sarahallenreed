I am happy to send sample copies, either digital or print, of my books and records free of charge for review purposes, so if you are a member of the press who would like to interview me for your publication, please reach out via the email address above.

If you would like to send me books, solicitations, letters, or anything else through the post, feel free to address it to the PO box used by the BLACKWORK team at:

All reasonably written letters which do not contain arsenic will be answered if possible; however, please allow at least a month or two for a response.
