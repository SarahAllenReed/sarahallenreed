Sarah is largely unable to respond to DMs on Instagram, and would strongly prefer that you do not attempt to reach her via Twitter's messaging feature either. Much like cats or security guards, goblins do not like hearing loud beeping noises at 3 AM.

If you would like to contact Sarah for a buisness or professional inquiry, please direct all inquiries to:

> [sketchreed@gmail.com](mailto:sketchreed@gmail.com)

If you would like to send Sarah things in the mail (no arsenic or pipe bombs, please) you are free to reach her through the PO box used by the BLACKWORK team at:


>  Sarah Allen Reed  
>  C/O BLACKWORK.  
>  PO Box 122  
>  Brunswick, ME 04011-0122  

All reasonably written letters which do not contain contraband will be answered if possible; however, please allow at least a month or two for a response.
