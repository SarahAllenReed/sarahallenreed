If you would like to contact me for a buisness or professional inquiry, or if you have a question about my work in any capacity, please direct all inquiries to:

> [sketchreed@gmail.com](mailto:sketchreed@gmail.com)

I am happy to send sample copies, either digital or print, of my books and records free of charge for review purposes, so if you are a member of the press who would like to interview me for your publication, please reach out via the email address above.

Unfortunately, I am between PO boxes at this time, and as a result no mail sent to any of the previous addresses I have held will be received. If you would like my personal mailing address in order to send me business-related correspondence, plead your case in an email directed to the above address. I regret to inform you that I cannot currently give out my mailing address for personal affairs at this time.
