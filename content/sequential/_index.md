A collection of sequential art samples and other resources for those interested in hiring me for their company or project, as well as for those interested in my visual storytelling style as a whole. If you would like to find out which books I have worked on and where to read them, please head to [the official Blackwork website](http://blackwork.org) or [click here](/resume). For illustration and fine art samples, please refer to the "Illustration" tab above, [or click here.](/illustration).

The "Comic Art Samples" page contains various exerpts from stories which should give you an idea of the full range of my abilities, should you be looking to hire me for your project or company. Each "Sample Story" below was both written and illustrated by yours truly, and they should give you an idea of the type of work I am most known for.

If you would like to view how I lay out full books, please refer to the [downloadable PDFs](/illustration/booklayoutsamples) that I have placed in the [Illustration section](/illustration) of this website.

If you would like your company or agency to help publish my next book, or if you would like me to lend my pen to your next pitch or script, [please click here.](/hireme)
