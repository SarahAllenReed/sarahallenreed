A collection of sequential art samples and other resources for those interested in hiring me for their company or project, as well as for those interested in my visual storytelling style as a whole. If you would like to find out which books I have worked on and where to read them, please head to [the official Blackwork website](http://blackwork.org) or [click here](/catalogue). For illustration and fine art samples, please refer to the "Illustration" tab above, [or click here.](/illustration).

The "Comic Art Samples" page contains various exerpts from stories which should give you an idea of the full range of my abilities, should you be looking to hire me for your project or company. Each "Sample Story" below was both written and illustrated by yours truly, and they should give you an idea of the type of work I am most known for.
