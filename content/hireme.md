## Skillset

My skillset includes, but is not limited to, the following:

* Full package design for books, records, games, and other types of products
* Poster, logo, and other marketing design materials
* Spot illustration
* Pencils, inks, flats, and full color page work for sequential art
* Editorial services, including copy editing, developmental, and substantive editing
* Feature articles, op-ed, specialized interest, or commentary article writing or ghostwriting
* Front and back end web design, as well as graphic design and consulting for social media platforms such as Bandcamp, Twitter, and Instagram

I am currently available for freelance work and commissioned pieces, as well as full- or part-time staff positions should you wish to retain my services.

Finally, if you would like to learn about my techniques I am also available for private illustration lessons, either over Skype or Discord or in person at my Colorado studio. [Please email me if you would like to know more.](mailto:sketchreed@gmail.com)

## Rates

* My current rate for illustration and design is 45/hr, minimum 2 hours. This is subject to change at any time, although I up this rate once a year at minimum to keep up with my cost of living.
* Most smaller pieces, depending on detail, run about three to five hours. I keep itemized timesheets for your references/files, and upon asking a couple quick questions about what you require, I will provide you with a quick estimate (which is not a final bill, mind; the final amount of hours needed for any given job can go up and down depending on a variety of factors, all of which will be explained in the timesheets) and I will request half of the estimate up front before work begins.
* I do request to retain copyright of whatever art, music, or design that I create for you. I often do retrospective collections and retaining publishing rights to my illustrations makes this an easier process. This is negotiable, but my rate per hour will double should you insist upon being given the copyright.
* Finally, should you request a hard copy of the piece itself, that absolutely is workable; I draw nearly all of my art by hand, and I'm more than happy to ship the image to you in exchange for the shipping costs. While I often use whatever is on hand for my comix work, I am more than happy to use archival materials, paper, and inks at no additional charge for yours should you decide to request the hard copy, so that the original of your piece will stand the test of time. Shipping, however, will be an extra charge.

I currently accept Paypal and Venmo.
